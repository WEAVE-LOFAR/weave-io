# Installation

You can install the `weaveio` python package from PyPI with the following command:

    pip install weaveio

## Database installation
`weaveio` uses `neo4j` as its backend database.
If you want to install the backend database and not just use an existing one, 
then you can install `neo4j` by following the instructions on [neo4j.com](neo4j.com/).
